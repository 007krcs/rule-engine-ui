# Release Checklist

Use this checklist before releasing RuleFlow changes.

![Docs overview](/docs/docs-overview.png)

## Required checks

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm validate:configs`
- `pnpm test:e2e` (when UI flow changes are included)

## Acceptance criteria

- Builder: drag/drop + keyboard reorder + save works.
- Rules: create/update/save and Explain behavior verified.
- Playground: input updates change rule outcomes in trace.
- Console: `Submit -> Approve -> Promote -> Export/Import` path works without errors.
- Docs: no placeholder text remains, screenshots render, code blocks remain readable on mobile.

## Manual accessibility checks

- keyboard-only navigation across Builder, Rules, Playground, Console
- visible focus style on interactive controls
- meaningful `ariaLabelKey` coverage
- unique and deterministic focus order for schema components
