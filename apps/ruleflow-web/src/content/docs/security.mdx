# Security

RuleFlow security controls in this demo platform:

- tenant isolation (`tenantId` required)
- deterministic runtime (no dynamic code execution)
- bounded execution and validation gates
- audit trails and replayability

## Practical guidance

1. Keep `versionId` immutable for production runs.
2. Enforce approval before promotion to ACTIVE.
3. Keep GitOps bundles signed and traceable.
4. Validate schemas in CI (`pnpm validate:configs`).
