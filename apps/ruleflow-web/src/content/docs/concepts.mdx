# Concepts

RuleFlow is composed of three deterministic engines:

- **Flow Engine**: finite state transitions (`back`, `next`, `submit`).
- **Rules Engine**: JSON AST conditions + actions (no `eval`).
- **API Orchestrator**: declarative REST/GraphQL execution from mappings.

## Determinism

Execution inputs are explicit:
- schema version bundle (`versionId`)
- context
- data
- event

Replay the same inputs and you get the same outputs.

## Governance

Configs move through lifecycle gates (`DRAFT -> REVIEW -> APPROVED -> ACTIVE`) with approval and audit history in Console.
