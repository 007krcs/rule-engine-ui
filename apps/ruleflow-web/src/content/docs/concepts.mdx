# Concepts

RuleFlow is composed of three deterministic engines.

- **Flow Engine**: Finite state machine for navigation.
- **Rules Engine**: AST-based conditions and actions.
- **API Orchestrator**: Declarative REST/GraphQL execution.

## Determinism
All execution inputs are explicit: schema versions, context, data, and events. Replay uses the same inputs to produce the same outputs.

## Governance
Configs flow through a controlled lifecycle and are promoted by users with appropriate RBAC roles.
