# Getting Started

Use this page as your first stop. It explains how data moves through RuleFlow, how config lifecycle works, and the shortest path from draft to runtime trace.

![Docs overview](/docs/docs-overview.png)

## Runtime data flow

RuleFlow executes with four explicit inputs:

1. **Config version** (`versionId`) selects one immutable bundle:
   - `uiSchema`
   - `flowSchema`
   - `rules`
   - `apiMappingsById`
2. **Execution context** (`context.*`) carries role, locale, device, tenant, and permissions.
3. **Data bag** (`data.*`) carries mutable form/runtime values (for example `data.orderTotal`).
4. **Event** (`back`, `next`, `submit`) drives flow transitions and rule execution.

Execution output is deterministic:
- next state
- updated data/context
- trace (flow + rules + API details)

## Config lifecycle

Every config package moves through:

`DRAFT -> REVIEW -> APPROVED -> ACTIVE`

Console actions:
1. `Submit` moves DRAFT to REVIEW and creates an approval request.
2. `Approve` moves REVIEW to APPROVED.
3. `Promote` moves APPROVED to ACTIVE and deprecates previous ACTIVE.

## First successful run (10-15 minutes)

1. **Create a draft config**
   - Open **Get Started** in the header.
   - Enter `tenantId`, `configId`, and `name`.
   - Click **Create draft**.
2. **Build UI**
   - In Builder (`/builder?versionId=...`), drag a palette item to canvas.
   - Reorder with drag/drop or **Move up** / **Move down**.
   - Click **Save**.
3. **Create rules**
   - Open Rules Builder (`/builder/rules?versionId=...`).
   - Click **Add starter rule**.
   - Click **Save**.
4. **Run simulation**
   - Open Playground (`/playground?versionId=...`).
   - Change a bound input such as `orderTotal`.
   - Click **Submit**.
   - In Trace, enable **Explain** and confirm rule match changes.
5. **Promote through governance**
   - Open Console (`/console?tab=versions`).
   - Click **Submit**, then approve in governance, then **Promote**.

## Flow editor workflow (JSON-first today)

RuleFlow currently exposes flow editing as a JSON workflow:

1. Open Console and click **Export** in **GitOps Package**.
2. Edit `bundle.flowSchema` in your JSON.
3. Return to Console and click **Import**.
4. Open Playground and test transitions (`Back`/`Next`/`Submit`).

For a full walk-through see `/docs/tutorial-flow-editor`.

## Import a sample in Console

Download the sample JSON template:

- [`/docs/ruleflow-sample-project.json`](/docs/ruleflow-sample-project.json)

Then:

1. Open `/console?tab=versions`.
2. In **GitOps Package**, click **Import**.
3. Pick your JSON file.

Note: GitOps import validates HMAC signatures. If you get a signature error, export a bundle from your environment first, then re-import that exported file as your baseline.

## Key IDs

- **configId**: stable product/tenant config identifier
- **versionId**: immutable config snapshot used by Builder/Rules/Playground
- **packageId**: internal package container ID shown in Console metadata
