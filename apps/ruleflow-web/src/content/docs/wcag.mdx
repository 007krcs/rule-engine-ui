# WCAG

Accessibility is a first-class requirement in RuleFlow validation.

![Builder props panel](/docs/builder-props-panel.png)

## Step-by-step checklist

1. Set `accessibility.ariaLabelKey` for every component.
2. Set `keyboardNav: true`.
3. Keep `focusOrder` unique and predictable.
4. In Builder, fix all validation errors before Save.
5. Verify keyboard-only flow in Builder and Playground.

### Example accessibility block

```json
{
  "accessibility": {
    "ariaLabelKey": "customer.name.aria",
    "keyboardNav": true,
    "focusOrder": 1
  }
}
```

## Where validation happens

- Builder validates on edit.
- Save is disabled while errors remain.
- issue links focus the offending component.

## Common failures

- missing `ariaLabelKey`
- duplicate `focusOrder`
- disabled keyboard navigation
