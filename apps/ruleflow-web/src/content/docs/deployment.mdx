# Deployment

RuleFlow ships as a monorepo with Turbo + pnpm. Recommended deploy steps:

1. Build all packages with `pnpm build`.
2. Publish schema + config registry artifacts.
3. Deploy the web app with `pnpm --filter ruleflow-web build`.

Use GitOps export to promote config versions between environments.
