# Deployment

RuleFlow ships as a pnpm + Turbo monorepo. `ruleflow-web` can run on Node or serverless hosts.

![Console versions list](/docs/console-versions.png)

## Step-by-step (Node)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

3. Build web app:

```bash
pnpm --filter ruleflow-web build
```

4. Start web app:

```bash
pnpm --filter ruleflow-web start
```

## Step-by-step (Serverless / Vercel)

1. Deploy `ruleflow-web` as a Next.js app.
2. Ensure the runtime can write to the configured store provider (`/tmp` for serverless).
3. Verify `/api/system/health` reports `canWriteToStore: true`.

## GitOps promotion workflow

1. In Console, click **Export** in **GitOps Package**.
2. Commit the bundle to your environment repo.
3. In target env, open Console and click **Import**.
4. Promote validated versions through lifecycle gates.

## Operational checks

- `/api/system/health` should pass and include `canWriteToStore: true`.
- `pnpm validate:configs` should pass in CI before promote.
- keep demo adapters clearly labeled when used in docs/examples.
