# Tutorial: Theming + CSS Variable Overrides

RuleFlow is headless and pluggable:
- the runtime is framework-agnostic
- adapters are the seam for rendering and styling
- the product UI uses first-party CSS variables so hosts can theme without rewriting pages

## Goal

Override colors/spacing/typography safely, without coupling to RuleFlow internals.

## 1) RuleFlow design tokens

The product app defines tokens in:
- `apps/ruleflow-web/src/app/globals.css`

They are plain CSS variables like:
- `--rf-bg`, `--rf-fg`, `--rf-primary`, `--rf-border`
- `--rf-radius-*`, `--rf-space-*`
- `--rf-font-sans`, `--rf-font-mono`

## 2) Override tokens in a host app

In a host app, set variables before rendering RuleFlow UI:

```css
:root {
  --rf-primary: #0ea5e9;
  --rf-accent: #16a34a;
  --rf-radius-md: 16px;
}
```

If you embed RuleFlow into a larger app and want scoping:

```css
.ruleflowMount {
  --rf-primary: #0ea5e9;
  --rf-bg: #ffffff;
}
```

Then mount RuleFlow inside that container.

## 3) Using a CSS framework (optional)

Companies can keep their framework-specific styling inside adapters:

- React: your adapter returns framework components (MUI, Chakra, Tailwind, etc)
- Angular/Vue: your renderer/adapter owns the HTML and classes

RuleFlow schemas remain unchanged; only adapter implementation changes.

## Common mistakes

- Changing layout widths with fixed pixel containers (prefer fluid + max-width where needed)
- Overriding component styles globally instead of scoping to a mount container
- Adding framework CSS that breaks form defaults (inputs, buttons) without a reset strategy
