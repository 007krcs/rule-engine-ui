# Tutorial: Console + Versioning

The Console is where admins manage the lifecycle of a config package: DRAFT -> REVIEW -> APPROVED -> ACTIVE.

It also includes:
- an audit log (who did what, when)
- a schema diff viewer (what changed between versions)
- GitOps export/import (signed bundle for promotion across environments)

## Step-by-step (10 minutes)

1. Create a new config
- Click **New Config** in the header.
- Give it a name (and optionally tenantId/configId in the Getting Started wizard).

2. Edit the config
- Open **Builder** and make a change.
- Open **Rules Builder** and add a starter rule.

3. Submit for review
- Go to **Console** -> **Versions**.
- Find your version in **DRAFT**, click **Submit**.

4. Approve
- Go to **Console** -> **Governance**.
- Click **Approve** on the pending request.

5. Promote to ACTIVE
- Back in **Console** -> **Versions**, click **Promote**.
- The previous ACTIVE version is automatically deprecated.

6. Diff the bundle
- Click **Diff** to see a JSON-level diff of (UI schema + flow + rules + API mappings).

7. Export GitOps
- In **Console** -> **Versions**, use **Export** under GitOps Package.

8. Import GitOps
- Use **Import** to load a GitOps bundle back into the demo store.

## Validator Gate (no dead buttons)

Submitting and promoting are blocked if validation fails:
- schema validity
- WCAG basics (ariaLabelKey + focus order)
- i18n coverage for required keys

If validation fails, fix issues in Builder/Rules and try again.
