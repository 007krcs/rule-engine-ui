# Tutorial: Console + Versioning

Console manages config lifecycle:

`DRAFT -> REVIEW -> APPROVED -> ACTIVE`

It also includes:
- audit log
- bundle diff viewer
- GitOps export/import

## Step-by-step (10 minutes)

1. **Create a config**
   - Click **New Config** or use **Get Started**.
   - This creates a DRAFT version and a `versionId`.

2. **Make a change**
   - Open Builder and add a component.
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Submit for review**
   - Open `/console?tab=versions`.
   - On your DRAFT version, click **Submit**.

4. **Approve**
   - Stay in Console and open governance cards (or `/console?tab=governance`).
   - Click **Approve** on the pending request.

5. **Promote**
   - Return to versions list.
   - Click **Promote** on the APPROVED version.

6. **Compare bundle diffs**
   - Click **Diff** on a version row to compare against ACTIVE.

7. **Export GitOps**
   - In **GitOps Package**, click **Export**.

8. **Import sample JSON in Console**
   - Download sample template: [`/docs/ruleflow-sample-project.json`](/docs/ruleflow-sample-project.json)
   - In **GitOps Package**, click **Import** and choose your JSON file.
   - If signature validation fails, export a bundle from your environment first and use that exported file as your trusted baseline.

## Validation gates

Submit and Promote are blocked when validation fails:
- schema validity
- accessibility checks (`ariaLabelKey`, unique `focusOrder`)
- required i18n key coverage

Fix issues in Builder/Rules Builder, then retry lifecycle actions.
