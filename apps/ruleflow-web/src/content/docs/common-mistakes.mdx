# Common Mistakes

## Builder / UISchema

- Missing `accessibility.ariaLabelKey`
- Missing or duplicate `accessibility.focusOrder`
- Layout references a component id that doesn't exist
- Adapter hint not registered in the host (renders as "No adapter for ...")

## Component Registry

- `adapterHint` not namespaced (`company.currencyInput` is good, `currencyInput` is not)
- `propsSchema` missing or not an object
- Duplicated `adapterHint` entries across manifests

## Rules

- Using paths that do not exist (`data.foo.bar` when `data.foo` is missing)
- Expecting UI inputs to update data automatically (host/event wiring is required)
- Throwing errors without handling them in the host

## i18n / WCAG

- Adding new i18n keys without providing bundles in the host
- Hard-coding strings instead of using `i18n.labelKey` and friends
