# Debugging

## Validation failures (Save/Submit blocked)

1. Open Builder and scroll to **Schema Preview**
2. Click the issue to focus the offending component
3. Fix `ariaLabelKey` / focus order / missing required fields

Tip: if you're stuck, temporarily switch to **Edit as JSON** and compare against a working sample.

## Runtime issues (Playground)

1. Open Playground and run **Submit**
2. In Trace:
   - Flow: check `reason` and guard results
   - Rules: check `errors` and which rules matched
   - API: check status code and endpoint

## Rules don't match

- Confirm scope filters (role/country/tenant)
- Confirm operands point at the right paths (`context.*` vs `data.*`)
- Toggle Explain mode to see per-rule match results

## API mapping errors

- Ensure the flow transition includes `callApi` and `apiId`
- Inspect Trace -> API for the request payload and response body
