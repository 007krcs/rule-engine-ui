# Debugging

![Playground trace](/docs/playground-trace.png)

## Validation failures (Save/Submit blocked)

1. Open Builder and inspect **Schema Preview** issues.
2. Click an issue to focus the component.
3. Fix missing required fields, accessibility, or schema type errors.

Tip: use **Edit as JSON** to compare against a known good sample.

## Runtime issues (Playground)

1. Open Playground and run **Submit**.
2. In Trace, inspect:
   - Flow reason and transition path
   - Rules matched, actions applied, errors
   - API request/response details

## Rules do not match

- confirm scope filters (`role`, `country`, `tenant`)
- verify operand paths (`context.*` vs `data.*`)
- enable **Explain** for per-rule details

## API mapping errors

- confirm transition action includes API call action
- inspect Trace API panel for status and payload
