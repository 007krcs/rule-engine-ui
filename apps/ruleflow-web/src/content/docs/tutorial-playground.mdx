# Tutorial: Playground + Trace

Playground simulates runtime execution:
- you choose a config version
- you simulate context (role, country, device, locale)
- you run flow events (Back/Next/Submit)
- you inspect a trace for Flow, Rules, and API

## Step-by-step (10 minutes)

1. Open Playground
- Navigate to `/playground`.
- Pick a version in the **Config Version** dropdown.

2. Simulate context
- Change `role`, `country`, `device`, or `locale`.
- This affects rule scope filters and any guard conditions.

3. Run flow events
- Click **Next** and **Back** to transition states.
- Click **Submit** to run:
  - flow transition
  - rules evaluation
  - API orchestration (if configured for the transition)

4. Inspect the trace
- Flow shows the transition and guard reason.
- Rules shows:
  - which rules were considered
  - which rules matched
  - which actions were applied
- API shows the demo request/response.

5. Explain mode
- Toggle **Explain** in the Rules section to see per-rule match results.

## Useful URLs

- Focus trace after navigation: `/playground?versionId=...&focus=trace`
- Auto-run submit: `/playground?versionId=...&autorun=submit&focus=trace`
- Auto-run + explain: `/playground?versionId=...&autorun=submit&focus=trace&explain=1`
