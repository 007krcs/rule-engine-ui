# Tutorial: Playground + Trace

Playground simulates runtime execution:
- you choose a config version
- you simulate context (role, country, device, locale)
- you run flow events (Back/Next/Submit)
- you inspect a trace for Flow, Rules, and API

## Step-by-step (10 minutes)

1. **Open Playground**
   - Navigate to `/playground`.
   - Pick a version in the **Config Version** dropdown.

2. **Simulate context**
   - Change `role`, `country`, `device`, or `locale`.
   - This affects rule scope filters and guard conditions.

3. **Update bound data**
   - Change a bound input (ex: `orderTotal`).
   - This should change which rules match.
   - Use the same `versionId` you edited in Builder/Rules so trace reflects your latest draft.

4. **Run flow events**
   - Click **Next** and **Back** to transition states.
   - Click **Submit** to run:
     - flow transition
     - rules evaluation
     - API orchestration (if configured)

5. **Inspect the trace**
   - Flow shows the transition and guard reason.
   - Rules shows:
     - rules considered
     - rules matched
     - actions applied
   - API shows the demo request/response.

6. **Explain mode**
   - Toggle **Explain** to see per-rule match results.

## Useful URLs

- Focus trace after navigation: `/playground?versionId=...&focus=trace`
- Auto-run submit: `/playground?versionId=...&autorun=submit&focus=trace`
- Auto-run + explain: `/playground?versionId=...&autorun=submit&focus=trace&explain=1`
