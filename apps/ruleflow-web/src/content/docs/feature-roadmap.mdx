# Feature Roadmap

The live roadmap is published at:

- `/system/roadmap`

Use this page to align planning assumptions in release and CI/CD workflows.

## Near-term focus

- Angular/Vue hydration hardening and parity with React behavior
- Visual flow builder authoring workflow
- Expanded date parsing and date arithmetic operators
- GraphQL-first orchestration improvements
- Layout engine expansion (nested/responsive/custom patterns)

## Interim expectation

Until each area is marked shipped on the roadmap:

- Use HTML renderer + host hydration in Angular/Vue
- Compute advanced date transforms in host boundary code
- Wrap GraphQL behind REST endpoints where required
- Use custom `adapterHint` namespaces for temporary layout extensions
